<text name="tip_ballistae">Tip: Ballistae will ignore some shield layers depending on their size, and sometimes cost missiles. They also deal random damage. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming bolts.</text>
<text name="tip_cannons">Tip: Cannons will ignore some shield layers depending on their size, and always cost missiles. They also deal random damage. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming cannonballs.</text>
<text name="tip_catapults">Tip: Catapult shots will be blocked by a single shield bubble, regardless of the stone's damage, however they also break an additional shield. They also deal random damage. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming stones.</text>
<text name="tip_jettisons">Tip: Jettisons are designed for killing crew. They fire a random number of shots, which don't do much damage individually, but can shred shields and crew. Enemy defense drones will shoot down incoming shots.</text>
<text name="tip_projectors">Tip: Projectors are specialized weapons which shoot beams of elemental fury. They are unable to pierce shields, but often cause chaos upon unprotected ships and their crew.</text>

<!--Custom Text Style
You can apply custom text style in the particular part of a text.

Notation: Surround the part you want to apply custom style in a text with start flag ([style[EXPRESSIONS]]) and close flag ([[/style]])

Expressions:

notation: "color:RRGGBB" or "color:RRGGBBAA" with hexadecimal (00 to FF). If AA (opacity) is ommitted, it defaults to 0xFF (255).
example: <text>This text is painted, like [style[color:FF0000]]Red[[/style]], [style[color:00FF00]]Green[[/style]] and [style[color:0000FF]]Blue[[/style]]!</text>

<!--Regarding Miniships
The icons provided are cropped from the existing miniships or tweaks to them, their vertical size is usually 20, this means when placing them in the icon box there is 
a 1 pixel offset between the icon image and the top/bottom edge, if the icon size is bigger it is still centered around the middle of the box, but may overlap.

Generally the order of icons is:
[auto ship(if the ship is an auto ship)], [crew], [present systems], [augments], [missing systems], [gimmick], [low power]
Generally the x gap between icons is 2 pixels, for icons with glow(phantom, STORE_BEACON) the distance is measured from the outmost opaque pixel.

Some icons have an uneven y size(for no reason usually), most of them are corrected to the correct size
    - crossed out system icons (fixed)
    - rusty/ion weapons (fixed)
    - Surge controller (not fixed)
    
Icons that are used for multiple things:
- EX_ION_ARMOR: OSMIAN_BATTERIES
- SLUG_GEL: PLEASURE_GEL, HEKTAR_GEL, EX_BREACH_SEALANT
- MULTIVERSE_DRIVE: MULTIVERSE_DRIVE_GOOD
- COMBAT_OXYGEN_JAMMER: COMBAT_OXYGEN_UNSTABLE
- WEAPON_PREIGNITE: ANCIENT_PREIGNITE
- GOLD_ARMOR: SCRAP_HULL

Arty, Temp , Cloak, shields, drones, medbay, Battery, TP, MC, Hack

<!--FOR UNLOCKS:
variant attribute is what variant you want the unlock method for (a, b or c)
silent attribute says whether or not it will show up in the top right and if it plays the sound etc

type is the unlock method (0 is beat flagship, 1 is reach sector, 2 is any victory, 3 is other ship unlocks, 4 is for event unlocks) (also i haven't tested beat flagship but reach sector works)
shipReq is the ship that you have to do it with to unlock it
value is only used for reach sector right now which says which sector the player has to reach

for the achievement icon that appears on the top right when you unlock the ship, you will need to add an icon in img/achievements 
it will use whatever the layoutFile is with "_1" put on the end
so for the engi ship, the layoutFile is mup_engi_b, so the icon would be img/achievements/mup_engi_b_1.png

you can also put multiple unlock methods which will let the player do ANY of them to unlock the ship
